### The website
[itbrainpower.net](https://itbrainpower.net/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Why should it be updated
* He uses this website to sell things but the webshop is not easy to find. 
* He focuses more on news about the products instead of selling it in an easy way.
* It doesn't help that the website doesn't have a clear structure. That way it doesn't really invite you to read about the products.
* Users don't really know what the site is trying to do when you visit it for the first time.
* The website looks like a scam instead of a legit webshop.

### Sociale media
The company isn't really active on social media. The guy himself is active different social media though.

&nbsp;

### Top three changes
**1. Make the website more user friendly**

  * A clear structure: what are the products, how do they work, where can you buy them, how much do they cost, ...
  * Adding subpages instead of throwing everything on one page
  * Use a menu to help people navigate
  
**2. Make the website easier to look at**
  * Change color scheme instead of just using white and red
  * Add more images
  
**3. Add a webshop**
  * Making it easier for him to sell things
